This Python Assignment is a simple Triangle Pattern Generator that allows users to print different types of triangle patterns using the * character. The program provides a menu-driven interface, where users can choose from the following three patterns:

1.Lower Triangular Pattern
  Prints a left-aligned triangle where each row contains increasing numbers of * from top to bottom.

2.Upper Triangular Pattern
  Prints a left-aligned triangle where each row contains decreasing numbers of * from top to bottom.

3.Pyramid Pattern
  Prints a centered triangle that grows in width with each row, forming a pyramid-like structure.

The user is prompted to enter their choice of pattern and the number of rows. Based on the input, the selected pattern is displayed. The program is written in a modular way using functions for each type of triangle to keep the code clean and reusable.
